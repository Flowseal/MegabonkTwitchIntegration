# Megabonk Twitch Integration

A BepInEx plugin that brings your Twitch chat directly into Megabonk! Watch as your viewers become part of the game experience and more...

## ðŸš€ Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Boss integration
* Bosses are automatically renamed to random Twitch chatters
* The assigned chatter's messages will appear above the boss

### ðŸ‘¥ Chatters invasion
* Regular enemies get random Twitch usernames as nicknames
* The nicknames are translucent and have an adjustable size so that there are no problems when playing

### ðŸ“Š (soon) Vote for choices
* Viewers can vote in the chat for the choice of an improvement or an item
* **Currently in-development** as I want to make a well-thought-out system so that a stream delay of some viewers does not interfere with the actual voting

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Install [latest BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/megabonk/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_IL2CPP/) for Megabonk
